# Changelog: Traditional Preservation (Fish)

## 0.2.5
- Internal: the tub's and frames' slot rules (adding, green border, refused-drop message) run on the shared core's
  `UI.slotRules`. Same rules, same messages.

## 0.2.4
- Internal: recipe times are set through the shared core (`Weather.setRecipeHours`). No change in play.

## 0.2.3
- Internal: tile numbers come from a `Tiles.lua` the art builder writes, instead of hand-kept numbers. Same art.

## 0.2.2
- Internal: the press timer uses the shared core's clock (`Weather.startClock/showClock`). Same timing.

## 0.2.1
- Fixed: a drying frame, beam or tub in a chunk that had just unloaded could still be updated, so its changes were
  lost or went to a stale chunk. Stations are now checked against the live cell.
- Changed: Time Remaining in the popup rounds up instead of down, as in the other TP mods.
- Fixed: the popup's Spoilage line could show the wrong text (a percentage was passed to the translator).
- Internal: runs on the shared Traditional Preservation core (weather, station tracking, popups).
